# React MD Icons [ARCHIVED]

*Note: this is no longer maintained. Was created because at the time no library had the icons I needed. There are now many good alternatives that are more complete and better maintained. I recommend [react-icons](https://gorangajic.github.io/react-icons/).*

A simple component library of [material design icons](https://design.google.com/icons/#ic_favorite).

This library is currently partial and only intended for personal use. Use at your own discretion.

No styles included, all icons wrapped in `md-icons` css class.
